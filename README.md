# Introduction
This is the stusy of à¸ºBoosted Feature Selection Method for Real Estate Valuation, written in Keras. The aim of this project is to

- provide a set of feature selection method based on NN model for real estate valuation.
- facilitate reproducible research and
- enable other researchers to use and compare these models as easy as possible on their data

# Requirements

To use the BoostedIGA method, you will need

- Python == 3.6
- tensorflow == 1.12.0
- Keras == 2.2.0
- sklearn == 0.6
- pandas & numpy

To use basedline method (RFE and RReliefF), you will also need

- sklearn-relief == 1.0.0b2

To run the sample script, you will also need

- matplotlib >= 2.2.3
